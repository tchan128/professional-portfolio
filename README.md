    <p align="center">
        The motivation for this project is to build a space and website that can showcase my skills and projects as I continue my growth in software development. I built this project because a professional portfolio is very important in order to help display one's strength while pursuing a career in software development. By building this portfolio, I now have a place to put all my projects as well as send them to others to look at. Through this project, I learned how important it is to continue to build projects to add to my portfolio. In terms of learnings I had with HTMl/CSS, I learned how important responsive layout is. It is crucial to consider individuals who might be using different devices to access certain websites and applications and tailoring it to their screen size can help attract more users and make the user experience better.

## About the Project

This project is a professional portfolio. This project is built with HTML and CSS. In the portfolio, there are 3 main sections. The "About Me" section introduces who I am, my skills, and interests. There you can get to know more of who I am personally. The "Work" section is a growing section that displays the projects that I have built. As I build more projects, they will be added, and the project that is most recent will be featured on top. The last section is a "Contact Me" section. There you will find different ways to reach me as well as my social media.

## Usage

This project, a professional project is built to display my previous projects as well as to get to know me and ways to contact me. In addition to it's purpose, there are some additional features that are included. One feature is that the portfolio is responsive to your screen size. This means that if you are viewing this on mobile it will display nicely as it does on a tablet or laptop. To test it out, you can also use Chrome DevTools to play around with the screen size to see it adjust accordingly. Another feature this project has is that it allows for users to hover over projects and go directly to those projects. Lastly, there are multiple links that are in this portfolio. While some are the usual links that goes to another website, some are new which directly lets user email or call me.
