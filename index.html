                    <p>Hi, my name is Tiffany Chan, and welcome to my page! I am 23 years old and currently working as 
                        an implementation specialist. I graduated from the University of Toronto in 2022 and majored in 
                        both psychology and cognitive science. This profile will showcase who I am and the projects that 
                        I have worked and am currently working on. I started getting in touch with programming back in 
                        university and finally got a chance to pursue the this passion a year after I graduated. I am currently
                        enrolled in a boot camp where I am learning the skills to become a software engineer. 
                    </p>
                    <p>    
                        I love cutting-edge technology and have always had a passion for computer science and anything tech related. 
                        My hobbies include traveling, video making, basketball, and building crafts from scratch. I used to live in China 
                        and got the chance to travel around Asia a lot. My favorite place to travel to is Japan. I enjoy video making and 
                        have my own Youtube channel where I document my trips. I used to play on my high school Varisty basketball team and
                        continued to play through University as well. I enjoy building crafts from scratch, I have many DIY projects making
                        miniature models. Lastly, I enjoy listening to music and watching sitcoms and TV shows on my off time!
